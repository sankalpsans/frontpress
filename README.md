frontpress
===========

Caution: Project still under dev.

Frontpress is a drop-in replacement for wordpress themes, which are, as of the time of writing this, heavy by the architectural design. 
It is not a full-fledged Wordpress theme, but that is what gives frontpress it's powers of speed and lightweightedness.
All you need to do is point frontpress to the corresponding Wordpress DB.

Note: frontpress is not supposed to be a CMS. It is supposed to be used with Wordpress or other known alternatives as CMS, which can deal with a Wordpess DB.

## Usage

1. Clone
2. Run `composer install` Change mapping in config.php
3. Point your PHP application server to the project directory.
4. Fly.
